# Stopwatch Android Application
  It is a simple Android Application which provides a basic User Interface to use a stopwatch.
  This Stopwatch application has 3 buttons, Start, Pause and Stop, and a chronometer, when start button is pressed, the timer starts and increses by
  1 second, when pause is pressed, the timer is paused and by pressing start again the timer resumes, when stop is pressed, it resets the timer to 0.
  
## Currently known issue
  When the timer is running, and stop is pressed, it does not stop the timer, but it sets the timer to zero and it starts counting again from 0.
